Q1. My name is Divyanshi.

Q2.
(a).Interpreter-An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or 			scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine 			code. Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python and Matlab
    Compiler- A compiler takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically 		      stored in a file. The object code is also refereed as binary code and can be 		      directly executed by the machine after linking. Examples of compiled programming 		      languages are C and C++.
(b). Python- Variables are not declared.
             It is an interpreted language.
             There is a large library of built-in functions in python
             It is easy to learn, write and read python programs than C.
             Python programs are saved by .py extension
     C- Variables are declared.
        It is a compiled language.
        There are a limited number of built-in functions in C.
   	Syntax of C is harder than python.
        Programs are saved by .c extension
    
Q3.
>>> a=10
>>> type (a)
<type 'int'>
>>> b= 4
>>> type (b)
<type 'int'>
>>> c= 3.4
>>> type (c)
<type 'float'>
>>> d= a/10
>>> d
1
>>> type (d)
<type 'int'>
>>> e= b*c
>>> e
13.6
>>> type (e)
<type 'float'>
>>> a= a*e
>>> a
136.0
>>> type (a)
<type 'float'>
>>> s= "IIITB"
>>> type (s)
<type 'str'>
>>> t= a + s
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'
>>> type (t)
Traceback (most recent call last):
